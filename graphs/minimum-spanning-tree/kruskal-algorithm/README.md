`Minimum Spanning Tree`

Given a weighted undirected algorithms. Find the sum of weights of edges of a Minimum Spanning Tree.

Input:
Given 2 integers N and M. N represents the number of vertices in the algorithms. M represents the number of edges between any 2 vertices.
Then M lines follow, each line has 3 space separated integers ai, bi, wi where ai and bi represents an edge from a vertex ai to a vertex bi and wi represents the weight of that edge.

Output:
Print the summation of edges weights in the MST.

Constraint:

2 <= N <= 10000
1 <= M <= 100000
1 <= ai, bi <= N
2 <= wi <= 1000
